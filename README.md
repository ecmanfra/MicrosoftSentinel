### Sysmon with Sentinel

Sysmon generates a ton of logs, yes they are more detailed and potentially contain more valuable information than standard event logs but they WILL increase your ingestion and retention costs.

Many have suggested using Olaf's modular sysmon config and keep the logs locally so they might be there when needed.
